# Example WebDriverIO SuperTest Project

A WebDriverIO and SuperTest project testing the functionality of 'phptravels.net'. 

PHPtravels.net does not retain login information, therefore we will need to use API requests to set up test data.

This proof of concept shows to implementation of API requests to quickly send requests to the server to set up test data or test scenarios.
